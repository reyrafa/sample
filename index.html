Why do I love you? Don't even want to
Why do I love you like I do? Like I always do
You should've told me, why did you have to be untrue?
Love you like I do, why do I love you like I do?
Like I always do

Why do I love you? Don't even want to

Suddenly she's leaving
Suddenly the promise of love has gone
Suddenly, breathing seems so hard to do
Carefully you planned it
I got to know just a minute to late, oh girl

Love you like I do, why do I love you like I do?

Ain't gonna show no weakness
I'm gonna smile and tell the whole world I'm fine
I'm gonna keep my senses but deep down
When no one can hear me, baby I'll be crying for you

Why do I love you? Don't even want to
Why do I love you like I do? Like I always do
You should've told me, why did you have to be untrue?
Love you like I do, why do I love you like I do?

You should've told me, why did you have to be untrue?
Love you like I do, why do I love you like I do?

Can't go back, can't erase
Baby, your smiling face, oh no
I can think of nothing else but you
Suddenly, suddenly

Why do I love you? Don't even want to
Why do I love you like I do? Like I always do
You should've told me, why did you have to be untrue?
Love you like I do, why do I love you like I do?
Like I always do

Why do I love you? Don't even want to
Why do I love you like I do? Like I always do
You should've told me, why did you have to be untrue?
Love you like I do, why do I love you like I do?
Like I always do

Love you like I do? Like I always do
Love you like I do? Like I always do
Love you like I do? Like I always do
Why do I love you?
Don't even want to
Why do I love you like I do?
Suddenly she's leaving
Suddenly the promise of love has gone
Suddenly, breathing seems so hard to do
Carefully you planned it
I got to know just a minute to late, oh girl
Now I understand it
All the times we made love together
Baby, you were thinking of him

Why do I love you? Don't even want to
Why do I love you like I do? Like I always do
You should've told me, why did you have to be untrue?
Love you like I do, why do I love you like I do?

Ain't gonna show no weakness
I'm gonna smile and tell the whole world I'm fine
I'm gonna keep my senses but deep down
When no one can hear me, baby I'll be crying for you

Why do I love you? Don't even want to
Why do I love you like I do? Like I always do
You should've told me, why did you have to be untrue?
Love you like I do, why do I love you like I do?

Can't go back, can't erase
Baby, your smiling face, oh no
I can think of nothing else but you
Suddenly, suddenly

Why do I love you? Don't even want to
Why do I love you like I do? Like I always do
You should've told me, why did you have to be untrue?
Love you like I do, why do I love you like I do?
Like I always do

Why do I love you? Don't even want to
Why do I love you like I do? Like I always do
You should've told me, why did you have to be untrue?
Love you like I do, why do I love you like I do?
Like I always do

Love you like I do? Like I always do
Love you like I do? Like I always do
Love you like I do? Like I always do
Why do I love you?
Don't even want to
Why do I love you like I do?
Suddenly she's leaving
